# Project Title: Automated Waste Material Categorization Using Computer Vision Techniques

I. Introduction

(a) Problem Context and Chosen Theme

The escalating volume of global waste, with over 2 billion tons generated annually [World Bank, 2022], poses a substantial challenge to waste management systems. Landfills are under increasing strain, emphasizing the critical need for innovative solutions. This project focuses on leveraging computer vision techniques to automate the identification and categorization of diverse waste materials. The chosen theme revolves around the application of artificial intelligence, specifically computer vision, to streamline the waste segregation process.

II. Problem Statement

(b) Problem Addressed and Research Questions

The manual effort and time required by trash separators to categorize diverse waste materials in landfills are significant, contributing to operational inefficiencies. The research questions of this project are:

•	How can computer vision techniques be optimized to accurately identify and categorize a diverse range of waste materials based on visual cues?
•	What is the feasibility and effectiveness of extending the automated waste categorization solution to domestic households to improve waste segregation practices?
•	How can real-time data collection on-site contribute to the adaptability and robustness of the computer vision model in handling dynamic waste compositions?
